Compiler development is the royal discipline of computing. They have always demanded the highest skills from their makers and they always fascinated me the most as a developer. While compiler technology has been well understood in academics since long, mainstream implementations were often lacking behind today's standards -- being quirky, proprietary and hard to master.

With the advent of [LLVM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2354725/what-exactly-is-llvm) a lot of this changed and today we have state of the art compiler technology right at our fingertips - with a [clean three-phase architecture](www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html), [open-source](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/) and reusable.

My name is Stefan Gr√§nitz and I use this blog to share my experiences. In my spare time I am hacking on compilers and tools. As a freelance developer I help companies to develop, maintain and port LLVM-based technology of different flavors here in Berlin and remote.
